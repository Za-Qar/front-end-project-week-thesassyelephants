# Mentor Matcher for programmers - React

This project was done in a group of 5 over a span of 4 days. We were tasked with creating a platform were mentors and mentees can visit, submit a form and get matched with one another based on specific criterion. The criterion include the skills the mentee wants to inherit for their future plans and also a myers Briggs personality type. Essentially we wanted mentors and mentees to have compatible personality types after reading a scientific article that this way the learning is enhanced. [View project]( https://mentor-matcher.netlify.app).

We used Auth0 for authentication and their emails were used for verification. Once the mentor or mentee fill out their respective form, they can then go to the "Find your match" page and either get all data, which matches based on skill, or input their 4 letter myers Briggs result that is linked in the form they already submitted and get data based on personality types.
